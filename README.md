## Overview

This repository contains concise solutions to C programming exercises covering input/output, conditionals, loops, and file handling. Each task focuses on reinforcing basic C programming skills.

---

## Task 1: Input and Output Formatting

### Objective
Read two characters, a float, and an integer from the user in a single line, then output each on a separate line.

### Sample Run
```bash
Enter two characters, a space, a float, and a decimal:
Hi 3.141516 54
Hi
3.141516
54
```

---

## Task 2: Conditional Evaluation

### Objective
Evaluate `if` statements based on variable conditions and determine the value of `a`.

### Key Results
```bash
- `if (b > c)` → **False**  
- `if ((e / d) + 6)` → **True**  
- `if (a -= ((b > c) || (e / d)) + 6)` → **True**, `a = 25`
```

## Task 3: Grade Calculator

### Objective
Determine the letter grade based on numeric input using `if-else` logic.

### Sample Run
```bash
Please enter the numeric grade: 85  
The letter grade is a B.
```
---

## Task 4: Loop Printing

### Objective
Print `x` from 0 to 9 using a `for` loop.

### Sample Run
```bash
x=0  
x=1  
...  
x=9
```
---

## Task 5: Even and Odd Numbers

### Objective
1. Print the first 20 even numbers in ascending order.  
2. Print odd numbers between 50 and 20 in descending order.

---

## Task 6: Running Sum with Sentinel Value

### Objective
Continuously add user-entered numbers, terminating when `-1` is input.

### Sample Run
```bash
Current Sum: 0  
Please enter the next number: 5  
Current Sum: 5  
...  
Please enter the next number: -1  
Done!
```
